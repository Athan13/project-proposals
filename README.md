# Hosting Projects under the OpenWallet Foundation
The OpenWallet Foundation (OWF) is the home to various open source,
open data and/or other open projects relating to or supporting development
of digital wallets, including infrastructure and support initiatives related.
The [OWF Project Lifecycle](https://tkuhrt.github.io/owf-tac-proposal/governance/project-lifecycle/)
specifies the stages that a project may be admitted under and what the
criteria and expectations are for a given stage, as well as the acceptance
criteria for a project to move from one stage to another.

The project proposal process is the same for both existing projects which
seek to move into the OpenWallet Foundation and new projects to be formed
within the OpenWallet Foundation.

This repository will be used for OpenWallet Foundation project proposals.
It contains the [proposal template](./proposal-template.md) and projects
that have been proposed for consideration to the OpenWallet Foundation TAC.

# Instructions for Proposing a Project
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/project-proposals).
2. Copy the `proposal-template.md` file to the `projects` directory and rename the file to `project-name.md`, where _project-name_ is the name of your project.
3. Complete the template.
4. Commit your changes with proper sign-off. This means that your commit
log message must contain a line that looks like the following one,
with your actual name and email address:

        Signed-off-by: Jane Doe <jane.doe@example.com>

   Adding the `-s` flag to your `git commit` command will add that line
automatically. You can also add it manually as part of your commit
log message or add it afterwards with `git commit --amend -s`.
5. Submit a pull request.
